# 🎯 HireTrack — Job Application Tracker

> A full-stack job application tracking system built with React, Node.js/Express, and PostgreSQL — complete with JWT authentication, analytics dashboards, and automated email reminders.

## ✨ What HireTrack Does

HireTrack helps job seekers stay organized during their search. Users can:

- 🔐 Register and log in securely
- 📋 Add and manage job applications
- 🔄 Track and update application status (applied, interviewing, offer, rejected, etc.)
- 🔍 Search and filter applications
- 📊 View analytics on a visual dashboard
- 📧 Receive automated reminder emails for follow-ups

It spans **authentication, relational data modeling, REST APIs, data visualization, and scheduled background jobs** — a genuinely full-stack feature set.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React, Vite, Axios, React Router |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Auth** | JWT (access + refresh tokens), bcrypt |
| **Scheduled Jobs** | node-cron, nodemailer |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx |

## 🔐 Why this Authentication Design ??

Rather than a single long-lived token, the app implements a proper **access + refresh token pattern**:

- `backend/src/config/jwt.js` handles token generation and verification
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.js` guards protected routes, validating tokens before allowing requests through
- `frontend/src/api/axios.js` centralizes API calls, automatically attaches tokens, silently refreshes expired ones, and redirects to login on failure
- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** before storage

This is the kind of pattern used in real production systems, not just a toy `localStorage` token check — a strong signal of security awareness.

## 📊 Feature Highlights

### Application Management
Full create/read/update/delete flow for job applications, including CSV export — implemented cleanly across `routes/applications.js` and `controllers/applicationController.js`.

### Analytics Dashboard
Dedicated analytics endpoints (`routes/analytics.js`, `controllers/analyticsController.js`) power:
- Application counts by status
- Weekly activity trends
- Upcoming follow-up tracking

The dashboard isn't just decorative charts glued onto static data — it's backed by purpose-built database queries.

### Automated Reminder Emails
A `node-cron` job checks daily for applications needing follow-up and sends reminder emails via `nodemailer` — a great example of implementing background/scheduled work correctly in a Node app.

### Centralized Error Handling
A dedicated error-handling middleware ensures failures return clean, consistent responses instead of crashing the server — a small detail that reflects production-readiness.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose installed

### Run the full stack

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hiretrack
docker-compose up --build
```

This spins up the PostgreSQL database, the Express backend, and the React frontend (served via Nginx) together — no manual environment juggling required.

### Local development (without Docker)

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies API requests to the backend, so both can run independently during development.

## 🗺️ End-to-End Flow 

**Login:** `AuthPage.jsx` → `AuthContext` → `axios.js` → `routes/auth.js` → `authController.js` → `jwt.js`

**Applications:** `Applications.jsx` → `routes/applications.js` → `applicationController.js` → PostgreSQL → table updates

**Dashboard:** `Dashboard.jsx` → analytics endpoints → `analyticsController.js` → charts render

**Reminders:** `cron.js` runs on schedule → checks DB for due follow-ups → sends email via `nodemailer`

## 💬 Thoughts

What stands out most about HireTrack is the **coherence** of the system — the auth pattern, database layer, API design, and frontend state management all fit together the way you'd expect from a real production app, not a disconnected set of tutorial features bolted together. It touches nearly every core skill expected of a full-stack engineer: relational schema design, secure auth, REST API design, background job scheduling, and a clean, componentized React frontend.
